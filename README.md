- **Edit Event:** Events can be edited by clicking on them in the calendar.
- **Delete Event:** Users can delete events during the edit mode.
- **Dark Mode:** Switch between light and dark themes to suit your preference.
- **Local Storage:** All events are saved in local storage, so they remain even if you refresh or close the browser.
